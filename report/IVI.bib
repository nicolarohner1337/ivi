A simple example is that selecting a data case in one view shows that data case highlighted in all other views. In this section we define the underlying methodology and show how it has been applied historically and how it can be extended to provide enhanced power. In particular we focus on displays of aggregated data and linking domain-specific views such as graph layouts and maps to statistical views.},
